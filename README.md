### Hi there, I'm Dwayne Herzberg 👋

🌟 **About Me**:

I'm currently in my **final year of university studies**, and I'm passionate about embedded systems and hardware development.
Right now, I'm an **intern at Elektrobit Toulouse**, working with the Infineon Aurix TC3X7 microcontroller family. I focus on exploring key peripherals like QSPI, ASCLIN, EVADC, GPT, DMA and others within AUTOSAR 4.0.

Alongside my professional experience, I'm continuously growing my personal skills.
I'm transitioning from **SolidWorks to Fusion 360**, diving into **PCB design**, and constantly upgrading my local server infrastructure — working with Docker/Swarm, Proxmox, networking, Terraform, Ansible
